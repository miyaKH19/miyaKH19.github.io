					Something about me? I like collecting cute things and eating
					sugary foods. 
					<br>
					Over the summmer, I took on a small personal project to put together
					a DIY music box (picture above). It took several weeks, but it 
					was really satisfying being able to see it finished.

				<p id = "in" class="center-text"> Aside from DIY, I like to do some needle felting here and there- 
					making tiny, soft creatures in my spare time. The picture on the left
					is a felt giraffe with no spots (it is about four inches tall).
					<br>
					<br>
					This middle picture is from when I went to the 626 Night Market in
					Santa Anita Park. 626 is essentially a large gathering for food
					stalls and vendors that specialize in primarily cooking and selling 
					asian inspired and traditional food. The picture is a mango icecream-sherbert
					bear. I love icecream, but it was pretty difficult to want to eat something this 
					cute.
					<br>
					<br>
					As I mentioned earlier, I like to collect cute things. The right 
					picture is from a few years ago and was a small subset of my then
					collection of plush octopodes.

					A hobby that I've picked up relatively recently would be scuba diving!
					Over the summer, I was able to get my scuba diving license for Open Water.
					It was really fun being able to see a school of fish up close as well as
					the many friendly sea turtles in the reefs of Maui.

					This hobby was relatively close to my long-time hobby of swimming, so 
					passing the certification test was not too difficult.
