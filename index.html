				As of mid-September, this year has been very interesting. For me,
				it's been about self-improvement, new experiences, and the loss of
				wisdom teeth. Over the summer, I was able to go on vacation
				with my family. The picture above is one of the last places we visited
				on a hike during the Road to Hana. (The Pipiwai Trail which included 
				the Seven Pools of O'heo, a waterfall, and a bamboo forest.)

					The leftmost and middle pictures are from my family vacation to Maui.
					We got some really good shaved ice at Ululani's and were able to see
					a lot of beautiful scenery during our road trip around the island.
					<br>
					<br>
					After the trip, it was decided that I needed to get my wisdom teeth out, so,
					after a summer of eating quality food, I got four teeth extracted.
